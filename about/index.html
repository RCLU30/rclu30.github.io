<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ricky. I was born and raised in the Boston area, so I've lived through all kinds of weather; from nor'easter blizzards to unreasonable heat and humidity.</p>
<p>I went to Worcester Polytechnic Institute to study electrical and computer engineering. I ended up working in the electrical utility and in retrospect, but now I'm looking to get into web development.</p>
<p>I wish I had more content to fill here, but I don't have anything I want to talk about right now. Hope you had a good 30 second read.</p>
